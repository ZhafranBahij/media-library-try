## Why I Learn?

Someone recommend me to use "Media Library". Before using it, I don't think that package or library is useful enough to replace me using normal way to saving image in Laravel.

So yeahh, I plan to learn this with 1 week. But yeah, I only learn it for 4 day because I wanna explore another package.

## What I Learn?

For now, I only learn how to save media or image from file or link. After using it, I feel this package is so cool.

Yup, I can save multiple file without add new table again.

## Note

For more information, you can see Notion because I'm too lazy to put all thing in this readme.md

In Notion, I can write more easy.
